# Neural Layer Visualizer
An interactive web-based tool for visualizing the behavior of a single neural network layer. Users can adjust the number of neurons, their weights and biases, and experiment with different activation functions to see how these parameters affect the layer's output. This visualizer helps in understanding the fundamentals of neural networks through direct manipulation and real-time graphical feedback.

## Key features:

- Real-time plot updates
- Adjustable number of neurons
- Interactive weight and bias sliders
- Multiple activation functions
- Style
